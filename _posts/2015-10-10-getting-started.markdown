Hello, and welcome to Modern Web Development in Python! The goal of this
series is to help familiarize you with fundamentals common to nearly
every website on the internet, and to help you learn to build the things
you've always had an itch to build.

Now, I should start of by mentioning the goals of this series. By the end, I'd like
to help you:

- Build a complete web application (from bottom to top) that gives a starting point to progress to more advanced things if you desire.
- Get solid foundations for fundamentals common to nearly every website on the internet, all the way from databases to the user interactions.
- Provide additional content on more advanced topics, like user security, scaling,
and similar.
- By the end, I hope you'll have a complete site that allows uses to post
pictures and like, comment, etc. Think something sort of Pinterest- or Tumblr-like.

Now, I think it's also important to mention that, though I'll talk about
Python syntax and language to an extent, the direct goal of this series is not
to teach Python (or Javascript, HTML, CSS) the languages, but rather how to utilize
them effectively, so you some may need to brush up on or look up language fundamentals
elsewhere. I want to help provide the step beyond learning the languages -
actually using the languages to build cool things, and figuring out where to go
next. I will, however, provide some curated links to learning about some of these
things.

All the code for each step through will be hosted in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/bpicolo/modern-python-web).
Github is a social coding site, which essentially lets users share their code with others,
with an emphasis on open-source software (meaning the code is available to others
to see and use). I encourage using the GitHub issues section on the right in our repo
to ask any questions you might have, and I hope to build up a decent QA section that way.
